# About SupeNux
This is the official source code for SupeNux, an OS made on Linux technology. SupeNux is a AI-powered and powerful OS, with capabilities that (no offense) even Linux can't do in someways. Here are some (planned) features:         
**1. Clean homescreen**
- With the new and original homescreen design, with the start menu as simple as a red dot on the bottom-left corner. When you click the red dot, you get the "start miniu", which is "mini" + "menu", which is a bar with apps on the bottom. Then, on the ball, there is a little arrow symbol right next to it. When you drag that to the top-right to the screen, you can get the big start menu, which is a fullscreen computer tab with all of the apps you have on your computer.
- On the "start miniu",  there is a search bar at the end, and you can search for apps on your computer.

**2. New terminal and better syntax**
- With the new CLI for SupeNux called NuxShell, you can now have better and understandable syntax that anyone can understand and remember now. Instead "lsblk", it's now just "system.disk -info". See? Makes more sense and easy to remember!
- If you need help with the list of commands, just type in the command "help" to get a list of commands.

As for bigger companies, like for example, something as big as Microsoft, and if they want to use SupeNux for, let's say, server computing, then due to the nature/environment where SupeNux will be in, it range from $10,000-$50,000+.
