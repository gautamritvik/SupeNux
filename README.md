# SupeNux
This is the official source code for SupeNux, an OS made using Linux technology.

# License
This is the GitHub page to the (custom-made) license of SupeNux: https://github.com/gautamritvik/SupeNux/blob/main/LICENSE
**You can find the license by clicking the "License" tab above all this text ⬆️.**
What the license bascially states is that:
**1. Modification and Use**
    - The modifier (which is the person who distributes a modified version of SupeNux) HAS to give the source code, they cannot sell the source code/modified version of SupeNux, and they cannot distribute closed-source versions of a modified version of SupeNux. They also have to state somewhere where everyone can see that they made their modified OS based on Ritvik Gautam's OS SupeNux.
**2. Commercial Use**
    - If any companies/organizations want to use SupeNux, they will first have to get an agreement, which could be a contact form, email confirmation, etc. But, as stated in "1. Modification and Use", they have to release the source code publicly and keep any modifed version of the software and the source code free and open-source from their side.
