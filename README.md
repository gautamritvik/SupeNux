What the license bascially states is:
**1. Modification and Use**
    - The modifier (which is the person who distributes a modified version of SupeNux) HAS to give the source code, they cannot sell the source code/modified version of SupeNux, and they cannot distribute closed-source versions of a modified version of SupeNux.

**2. Commercial Use**
    - If any companies/organizations want to use SupeNux, they will first have to get an agreement, which could be a contact form, email confirmation, etc. But, as stated in "1.

    - They need to pay a monthly fee for commercial use. The amount of the monthly fee depends on the nature and enviorment the software will be used in (for example, if a small startup wants to use SupeNux for office computing, for flexibility and nature/environment purposes, the monthly fee could be around $50-$100. As for bigger companies, like for example, something as big as Microsoft, and if they want to use SupeNux for, let's say, server computing, then due to the nature/environment where SupeNux will be in, it range from $10,000-$50,000+. For monthly confirmation that the company/organization, they have to send an email/text message to Ritvik Gautam that they have successfully paid their monthly fee. Attribution, as stated in "1. Modification and Use" and "3. Attribution", they have to state somewhere where everyone can see that they made their modified OS based on Ritvik Gautam's OS SupeNux.
