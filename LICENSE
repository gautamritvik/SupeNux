Please note that the word “software” in this document means the OS SupeNux, which was made by Ritvik Gautam and is based on Linux technology, that the word “modified” in this document means direct modifications and derivative works, and the word “companies/organizations” in this document means the commercial businesses that will use this software (SupeNux OS).

This license agreement shall be governed by and construed following the laws of the state of Florida in the United States of America. Any disputes arising from this agreement shall be subjected to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the state of Florida in the United States of America.

Permission is granted to any person or entity to view, modify, and use this software only if they compile according to the following conditions:

1. Modification and Use
  If any modified version of this software is released to the public, they have to release the source code to the public, and the modifier has no option to sell the modified software for any currency. If you use this source code, modify it, and release it to the public, you have to state somewhere that everyone can see and state that the modifier took the source code by Ritvik Gautam.
  The licensee cannot, under any circumstances, distribute closed-source versions of the software. Any version of this software has to remain open-source under this license.
2. Commercial Use
  Suppose any companies or organizations want to use this software for commercial purposes, including using it in any business environment. In that case, they will need to get permission (an agreement, which may include a contact form or email confirmation) from Ritvik Gautam. Still, at the same time, the companies/organizations have to keep any modified version of the software from their side free and open-source. They also have to pay a monthly fee. The fee price will vary among different companies/organizations because of the nature and environment the software will be used in (for small businesses, for flexibility, they have to pay ~$50-~$100. As for bigger companies, like Microsoft, it can range from ~$10,000 to more.). How Ritvik Gautam will know if they paid their monthly fee is that every month, they have to give him an email/text message for proof that they’ve successfully paid their monthly fee. Ritvik Gautam will expect attribution of the software from the companies/organizations, though. How to follow attribution rules is stated in "3. Attribution".
  If the companies/organizations fail to pay the fees on time, they will have to pay an extra fee as a penalty (e.g., small companies = ~$50. Big companies = ~$5,000 - ~$10,000+.), and if they don’t pay on time for more than two months, they could have their permission to use SupeNux revoked. When the companies/organizations use the software, they have to make at least one open-source contribution to the SupeNux project, like making advancements in the source code or making bug fixes (they can do this on GitHub as of 10/2024), donating money to the SupeNux project, and more. They also have to donate to at least one charity of any kind that supports good causes or helps different types of life in need (e.g., St. Judes Children's Research Hospital, Feeding America, Direct Relief, Good 360, United Way Worldwide, etc.) and the amount they have to pay depends on the nature and environment the software is being used in (e.g., small companies = ~$100+. Big companies = ~$1,000+.).
3. Attribution
  As stated in "1. Modification and Use", any released version of the software has to be stated somewhere that everyone can see, and the modifier has to state that the modifier took the source code by Ritvik Gautam.
4. Liability
  The software, “as is,” also with any third-party use, without any warranty of kind, expressed or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a specific purpose, and noninfringement. This means that if damage has occurred with the system for someone, then Ritvik Gautam is NOT liable for ANY of the damages.

By using, modifying, or distributing this software, the Licensee agrees to compile by the terms of this license.
