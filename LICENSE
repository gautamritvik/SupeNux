If you have to use this software for office or other purposes, please let your employing company/organization or mandating person/entity know that you don't agree to the license of SupeNux, as they have already agreed to the license (for office computing in their offices, if they are a company/organization).

Permission is granted to any person or entity to view, modify, and use this software only if they work according to the following conditions:

1. Modification and Use
  If any modified version of this software is released to the public, they have to release the source code to the public for absolutely NO price in ANY currency, and the modifier has no option to sell the modified software for any currency. If someone uses the source code of SupeNux/SupeNux it self, modify it, and release it to the public, they have to state somewhere that everyone can see and state that they made their OS based on Ritvik Gautam's OS SupeNux.
  The licensee cannot, under any circumstances, distribute closed-source versions of the software. Any version of this software has to remain open-source under this license.
2. Commercial Use
  Suppose any companies or organizations want to use this software for commercial purposes, including using it in any business environment. In that case, they will need to get permission (an agreement, which may include a contact form or email confirmation) from Ritvik Gautam. Still, at the same time, as stated in "1. Modification and Use", the companies/organizations have to keep any modified version of the software and the source code of it free and open-source from their side. They also have to pay a monthly fee. The fee price will vary among different companies/organizations because of the nature and environment the software will be used in (for small businesses, for flexibility, they have to pay ~$50-~$100. As for bigger companies, like Microsoft, it can range from ~$10,000 to more.). How Ritvik Gautam will know if they paid their monthly fee is that every month, they have to give him an email/text message for proof that they’ve successfully paid their monthly fee. Ritvik Gautam will still expect attribution of the software from the companies/organizations. How to follow attribution rules is stated in "3. Attribution".
  If the companies/organizations fail to pay the fees on time, they will have to pay an extra fee as a penalty (e.g., small companies = ~$50. Big companies = ~$5,000 - ~$10,000+.), and if they don’t pay on time for more than two times in a row, they could have their permission to use SupeNux revoked. When the companies/organizations use the software, they have to make at least one open-source contribution to the SupeNux project, like making advancements in the source code or making bug fixes (they can do this on GitHub), donating money to the SupeNux project, and more. They also have to donate to at least one charity of any kind that supports good causes, helps different types of life in need, and more (e.g., St. Judes Children's Research Hospital, Feeding America, Direct Relief, Good 360, United Way Worldwide, etc.) and the amount they have to pay depends on the nature and environment the software is being used in (e.g., small companies = ~$100+. Big companies = ~$1,000+.).
